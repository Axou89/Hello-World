The aim of this repo is to collect all possibility of write "hello world" in all programming language


# Contributing

if you want add one hello world in a language who is not in this repo

you must respect 3 rules :

 - create new dir with name of programming language 
 - add code file with good extension **ONLY** (for example : for a compilate language , i don't want the binary file)
 - add a `readme.md` for explain why run script and link of the language (you can see example [here](/Python/Readme.md))
